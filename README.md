# RaspberryPi-Joystick

The goal of this project is to create a virtual USB HID joystick which is able to convert BT mice/keyboard or USB mice/keyboard to joystick HID actions.

This Raspberry Pi joystick converter is based on RaspberryPi 4B/zero and can be used to operate Xbox Adaptive Controller or NS console for practical use cases.

## Updates
