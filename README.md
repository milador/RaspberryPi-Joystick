# RaspberryPi-Joystick

The goal of this project is to create a virtual USB HID joystick using Raspberry Pi which can convert BT mice/keyboard or USB mice/keyboard to joystick HID actions.

This Raspberry Pi joystick converter can be used to operate Xbox Adaptive Controller or NS console as practical use cases.

A RaspberryPi 4B or a raspberry pi zero W can be used for this project.

The new versions of raspberry pi zero W come with USB OTG and bluetooth chip which makes it possible to use Bluetooth HID devices as well as USB HID.

A RaspberryPi 4B can also be used instead of a Raspberry pi zero W.

This project is in development process at the moment.

We now go over the hardware and software requirements.

# Setup 

Here are the hardware and software setup process instructions:

## [Hardware requirements and setup](./HARDWARE_SETUP.md) ( HARDWARE_SETUP.md )

## [Software requirements and setup](./SOFTWARE_SETUP.md) ( SOFTWARE_SETUP.md )


# Manual setup instructions   

The setup process for each gamepad configuration can be performed manually as well. You can chose the configuration that matches your needs and follow the steps.
